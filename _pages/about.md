I am an ELLIS PhD Candidate in the [Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems Group](https://www.sias-uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). My research focuses on fairness, cooperation, and collective action in evolving social networks, as part of the ERC-funded RE-LINK project. I develop computational models for responsible link recommendation algorithms that promote socially desirable outcomes while maintaining user engagement. By analyzing trade-offs between social mechanisms and recommendation utility, I aim to identify conditions under which fair and socially responsible network dynamics emerge.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (Cum Laude) from the University of Amsterdam in 2024. Before that, I worked for three years as a software engineer: first as a full-stack developer at Credit Suisse and later as a backend developer at KlearStack. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](https://pict.edu/) in 2019.
