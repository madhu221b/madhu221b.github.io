I am currently a final year Masters in Artificial Intelligence student at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). Prior to that I worked for three years as a software engineer: First as a full-stack developer at Credit Suisse and later as a backend developer at a startup - KlearStack. I obtained my Bachelors in Computer Engineering Degree from [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](https://pict.edu/) in 2019.

My interest has been in areas where AI intersects with sustainability, urban planning and policy-making. I am actively looking for opportunities as an ML Engineer or Data Scientist where I can learn, contribute and be part of impactful projects.
