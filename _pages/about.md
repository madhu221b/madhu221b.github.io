I am currently a final year Masters in Artificial Intelligence student at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). Prior to that I worked for three years as a software engineer. I obtained my Bachelors in Computer Engineering Degree from [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](https://pict.edu/) in 2019.

Currently I am exploring my research interests. I am interested in areas where AI intersects with sustainability, urban planning and policy-making. I hope to dive more deeper in this area and find relevant projects for myself.
